## **1. Introduction.**
This is a simple imageJ macro i wrote to modify the poor quality images acquired with an old camera in optical microscopy. I try to substract the background to the original picture and then modify the pixels with a gamma function to Hematoxylin/Eosin images from islets of Langerhans in pancreatic sections. The final result is an approach to the real image the observer can see in the microscope, avoiding the worse acquisition by the camera.
